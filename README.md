# StormReconfigurableDbus

A project that creates basic Storm Bolts and Spouts that can interface with DBus. 

Code from Matthew Johnson is included for both the freedesktop.org Java DBus API and other system functions
not included with the Java DBus API but are still needed for compilation.

Note: The Apache Storm libraries are needed in order to compile this code. Storm is available at: https://github.com/apache/storm
